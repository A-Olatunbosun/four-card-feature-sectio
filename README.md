## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use CSS Grid to create layouts by utilizing its properties. I gained an understanding of how to position items using grid lines and how to span items across multiple rows and columns. Additionally, I applied the Mobile-First approach while building this project.

### Useful resources

- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This is an amazing web-developer site that provide free tutorials and hands-on coding excercise, free and online tutorials with lots of examples. I'd recommend it to anyone learning web-development
